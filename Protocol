Security protocols:
    1. Initial key exchange done through RSA public key swap
    2. Messages are wrapped in the following layers:
        a. Nonce layer for consistent length
        b. HMAC layer for message integrity
        c. ADS layer for encryption
    3. The potential vulnerabilities for:
        a. Message integrity:
            i. Distribution: messages will fail decryption if sent to the wrong recipient
            ii. Source: messages are signed as part of encryption
            iii. Traffic: encryption ensures that traffic can only be noted, but not read
            iv. Contents: encryption makes message contents secure
            v. Timing: operations are padded to hide operation
            vi. Sequence: the forced delays and the HMACed timestamp checks ensure proper order
            vii. Destination: messages will fail decryption if sent to the wrong recipient
            viii. Source:
        b. Attacks
            i. Replay attack: the forced delays combined with the HMACed time and 100ms packet expiration means that replay attacks will fail
