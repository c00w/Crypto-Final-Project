Crypto Final Project
By Colin Rice, Samuel Milto, Jacob Shedd

To build:
    make

Note that the key is regenerated on each make.
You need g++-multilib and the 32 bit stdc++ and libcryptopp installed

Our protocol is documented for others in Protocol.
Our own internal notes are in MESSAGE_PROTOCOL.
They are less obvious but what we used when we wrote it
We also included the git repo for fun.
