Account enumeration.
Transfer 0 dollars to various usernames [addressed, Sam]

Keys
They gave us their account keys

Threading
Can withdraw multiple times. No locks on a per thread basis [addressed, Sam]

Don't verify negatives on server, only client
Don't verify balances non negative

Used floats for balance

Transfers withdraw money if account doesn't exist [addressed, Sam]

Fucked up timeout settings [addressed, Sam]

Fucked up limits, bank can't do anything

Check for format string attacks

Send login info with every request

Can't login to user if transferred multiple times

Ignore last digit of card [addressed, Sam]
[note that it actually ignores literally the entire card and just checks if it's empty]

Can check if user exists from login screen with spoofed card. [doesn't actually work, Sam]
No user, spoofed card leads to different error message
than valid user, spoofed card

Unsustainable for large numbers of users. O(N) lookups? Really? [addressed, Sam]

Send PIN in cleartext, and card text

Shitty code quality, inconsistent tabbing, spacing.

No authentication on atm to bank handshake

bank can deposit floats

Can pretend to be bank
Thus infinite money withdraws
And thus send us card and pin
Actually not.
But can hang atm's like crazy with junky packets
And if you can guess nonce, can steal PIN's

Nonce is not 256 bit. Its in hex bitches. Thus much weaker

Source repo is bad.

Incorrect HMAC
Just a straight up fucking hash
Put inside of encryption layer

Proxy fucking crashes atm
Gives Key Information
Crash Banks
Don't do get password correctly

Can lock out users, ctrl+c atm
Or crash atms
